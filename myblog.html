<p style="font-size:150%;">I am 19 years old and I am from Framingham, MA, a city outside of Boston that recently became a city this past summer. One of the most important things in my life is my family so here is a picture of them. My dad, Ken. My mom, Dyan. And my older brother, Jake. We went to florida this past spring break to watch my brother play lacrosse and those the pictures above. Another place we have been is Atlantis in the Bahamas and that is the other picture. That is my favorite place in the world not only because its gorgeous but because it is a special place for my family. Another important part of my life is school, go check out my UMaine page!</p>
